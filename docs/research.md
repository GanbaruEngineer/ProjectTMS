# Research Notes

## Purpose
Maintain a running summary of scientific literature, datasets, and external references supporting the project.

## Key Research Areas
- Tsunami physics  
- Hydrodynamics  
- Coastal engineering  
- Materials & structural analysis  
- Disaster mitigation systems  

## Sources Reviewed
- (Add paper summaries, links, notes)

## Gaps Identified
- Need for modern structural modelling references  
- Need for validated tsunami datasets  

## To-Do
- Review 10–15 core papers  
- Summarize modelling techniques  
- Build a reference dataset
