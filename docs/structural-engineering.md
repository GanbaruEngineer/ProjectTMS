# Structural Engineering Module

## Purpose
To design, analyze, and evaluate physical structures that can reduce tsunami energy or redirect flow, improving coastal resilience.

## Scope
- Structural concept development  
- Material behavior assumptions  
- Load modelling under hydrodynamic pressure  
- Failure modes and safety factors  
- Integration with the computational simulation module  

## Engineering Concepts
- Breakwaters  
- Flow-redirecting barriers  
- Submerged energy-dissipating structures  
- Hybrid systems  

## Tools / Methods
- FreeCAD/Fusion 360 for CAD modelling  
- Structural FEA tools (Code_Aster, SOFA, or equivalent)  
- Python scripts for simplified analytical models  

## Current Progress
- Concept sketches  
- Preliminary structural requirements drafted  

## To-Do
- Define load cases  
- Model prototype geometries  
- Simulate stress responses under predicted wave loads
