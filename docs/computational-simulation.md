# Computational Simulation Module

## Purpose
To create accurate, physics-based numerical simulations of tsunami behavior, wave energy dissipation, and structural interaction models.

## Scope
- Hydrodynamic modelling (e.g., shallow water equations)
- Finite-element or finite-volume numerical schemes
- Interaction of waves with obstacles or mitigation structures
- Comparative simulation of different structural concepts
- Parameter variation studies

## Tools / Technologies
- Python (NumPy, SciPy)
- MATLAB / Octave (optional)
- OpenFOAM or SWASH (future)
- Jupyter notebooks for experimentation

## Model Assumptions
List assumptions here:
- Example: Non-linear shallow water equations
- Example: Rigid-body interaction approximations

## Current Progress
- Framework initialization  
- Notebook prototypes planned  

## To-Do
- Create baseline tsunami propagation model  
- Integrate boundary conditions  
- Validate model with historical tsunami data
