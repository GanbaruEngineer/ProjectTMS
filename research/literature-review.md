# Literature Review

## Purpose
This document summarizes academic papers, reports, and resources relevant to tsunami behaviour, coastal mitigation, and structural engineering.

## Review Strategy
- Prioritize peer-reviewed papers (2010–present).
- Focus on shallow water equations, FSI, and coastal engineering.
- Include both numerical and physical modelling references.

## Key Papers Reviewed
`None`

## Main Insights
- Project TMS will be a contribution to many coastal disaster management issues when it can be a ready-to-deploy system

## Gaps in Current Research
- Lack of low-cost structural mitigation designs.
- Limited simulation of real coastal terrain irregularities.
- Few comparative studies of structure positioning.

## Next Tasks
- Summarize ≥10 core tsunami-modelling papers.
- Add structural engineering references.
- Document equations used across the literature.
