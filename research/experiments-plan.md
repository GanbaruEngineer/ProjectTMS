# Experiments & Simulation Plan

## Purpose
To outline planned computational experiments and simulation tasks.

## Planned Experiments

### Experiment 1 — Baseline Tsunami Propagation
- Objective: Validate wave model without structures
- Inputs: Bathymetry, initial wave height
- Outputs: Time-series of wave height & velocity

### Experiment 2 — Structure Interaction Test
- Objective: Measure reduction in flow energy
- Variables: Structure size, shape, material

### Experiment 3 — Multi-Structure Performance
- Objective: Test multiple layers of structure placement
- Metrics: Energy dissipation, force reduction

### Experiment 4 — Real-World Scenario Simulation
- Objective: Simulate a historical tsunami with TMS structures added

## Evaluation Metrics
- Peak pressure reduction
- Flow velocity drop
- Structural stress distribution
- Cost–performance index

## To-Do
- Write simulation scripts
- Define boundary conditions
- Document variable ranges
