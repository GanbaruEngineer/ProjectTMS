# Research Methodology

## Purpose
To define the scientific methods used throughout Project TMS.

## Research Approach
1. Define core problems & assumptions
2. Collect scientific literature
3. Develop preliminary analytical models
4. Build computational simulation framework
5. Design structural systems
6. Integrate structure + simulation results
7. Run parameter sweeps and experiments
8. Draw conclusions and document findings

## Modelling Approach
- Numerical PDE solving for wave models
- FEA or analytical methods for structural stress
- Data-driven comparison between candidate structures

## Validation Methods
- Compare against historical tsunami data
- Check analytical vs numerical consistency
- Perform sensitivity analysis on key variables

## Expected Outputs
- Simulation datasets  
- Structural design evaluation  
- Research paper-quality documentation
