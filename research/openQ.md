# Open Research Questions

## Purpose
To maintain a list of scientific or engineering questions that require investigation.

## Current Open Questions
- How do different structure placements affect near-shore wave height?
- What is the optimal balance between structure cost and energy reduction?
- How do real coastal geometries change the effectiveness of designs?
- How should material fatigue be modelled for repeated tsunami cycles?

## Future Investigation Areas
- Hybrid natural + artificial mitigation approaches
- AI-driven optimization of structure placement
- Use of emergent materials for lightweight structures

## To-Do
- Prioritize the top 5 questions
- Assign each to the corresponding simulation tasks
